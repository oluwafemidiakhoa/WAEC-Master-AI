# Agent Instructions

- Maintain a consistent, minimal coding style: plain HTML/CSS/JS, clear naming, and predictable file structure.
- Do not add copyrighted or proprietary content. Use original or placeholder data for questions and assets.
- Keep everything GitHub Pages compatible: no backend, no absolute paths tied to a domain, and use relative URLs for assets and service worker registration.
